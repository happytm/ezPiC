### Gadgets

A Gadget is usually a pice of hardware which provides measurement data (sensors) or control external hardware (actuators).

The Framework distinguishs between active and passive gadgets. 
* An active gadget notifies the gateway by itself if a new measurement (or state) arrives, e.g. a packed arrived via serial interface, a door was opened and a sensor triggers. Generally spoken: a event is generated where ezPiC has no influence on it.
* A passive gadget is time triggered periodically by the framework to aquire data from the hardware. A typical device here is a temperature sensor.
